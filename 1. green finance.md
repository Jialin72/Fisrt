## 1. 为什么人们（投资者）青睐ESG投资（公司）？
>So brown firms end up performing poorly in bad states of the world when the climate shock hits. 
>In other words, brown firms are a bad hedge against climate shocks, whereas green firms are a great hedge against climate shocks, and that makes green firms safer, 
>and that’s why investors are willing to pay more for green firms, and that’s why they’re willing to accept lower returns on green firms. 
>And vice versa, brown firms are particularly risky because they’re gonna do poorly in bad times when a bad climate shock hits, and that makes them risky.
>That means investors demand higher expected returns on brown firms. 
## 2. will corporates be greener?
> One channel through which the social impact happens is through the cost of capital: green firms invest more; brown firms invest less. 
> The other channel is that managers are gonna make their firms greener, and the interesting thing is that they will do this even if they are not focused on ESG at all,
>  even if they simply maximize their market values. 
## 3. will the society be greener?
Yeah, I expect ESG investment to grow in importance for the simple reason that surveys indicate that it’s mostly the young who exhibit a preference for green investments.
You know, the old people are intrigued, but the young people are particularly interested, and of course the young are gonna account for an increasingly important proportion of our economy,
proportion of our wealth. They will inherit wealth. They will build some wealth themselves. So for that reason alone, I expect ESG investing to grow in importance. 
## 4. the role of governments?
**At the same time, I don’t think we should rely on ESG investing alone to solve our big social problems. I think the role of the government is essential here**
For example, if you wanna save, save our planet, you know? If you wanna solve the climate-change problem, the most efficient solution 
by far is for the government to impose a carbon tax, OK? Yes, we can fiddle around the edges with ESG investing and maybe make a little bit of impact here and there, 
but it’s much more natural for the government to take the lead on these big externality problems. 
> In addition, if you think about social issues, as opposed to environmental issues, in today’s polarized society, it makes a lot of sense for the government, 
> a democratically elected government, to make decisions about, you know, what should be and what should not be done.
> It seems much more difficult or challenging for a private firm to decide, “Well, this is socially just, and that is not socially just.” 
> So again, I hope ESG investing will continue making a positive contribution. I also hope that governments will do more.
