1. [All-or-nothing rewards](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/behavioral-science/2021/article/all-or-nothing-rewards-could-motivate-impatient-people)
phenomena：
(1)many people struggle with making lifestyle changes that don’t deliver immediate and tangible rewards.
Policy makers and health-care leaders similarly struggle with devising incentive schemes that are effective in the face of people’s impatience.
(2) 工资差异
(3) peer behavior
etc.
reference point: The results suggest that offering such all-or-nothing incentives could help encourage people
to make healthy choices and participate in vital social programs. **why?

It’s worth developing patience, and not simply for the latest gadget or outfit. Higher levels of patience have been linked to positive life outcomes, 
including in the realms of academic achievement, health, income, and even addiction mitigation. 
**The phenomenon observed in the study suggests that patience may be enhanced by keeping in mind how much you value an item or outcome, 
and reminding yourself that it will be worth the wait.**
